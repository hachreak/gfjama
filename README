GFJama - Galois Field Java Matrix Package

It's a porting of Jama library on Galois Field.
This library manipulate matrix and use finite field mathematics.
You have at disposition many method to find the transpose, sum/subtract matrix, multiply matrix, solve square matrices, find determinant, and other operations. 
There is a dedicate class to fill a matrix with random values.

You can use this kind of Galois Field: GF(2^3), GF(2^8), GF(2^16).
